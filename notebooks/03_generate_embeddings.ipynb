design for high performance applies to heavy_check_mark linux vms heavy_check_mark windows vms heavy_check_mark flexible scale sets heavy_check_mark uniform scale sets this article provides guidelines for building high performance applications by using azure premium storage you can use the instructions provided in this document combined with performance best practices applicable to technologies used by your application to illustrate the guidelines we use sql server running on premium storage as an example throughout this document while we address performance scenarios for the storage layer in this article you need to optimize the application layer for example if you re hosting a sharepoint farm on premium storage you can use the sql server examples from this article to optimize the database server you can also optimize the sharepoint farm s web server and application server to get the most performance this article helps to answer the following common questions about optimizing application performance on premium storage how can you measure your application performance why aren t you seeing expected high performance which factors influence your application performance on premium storage how do these factors influence performance of your application on premium storage how can you optimize for input output operations per second iops bandwidth and latency we provide these guidelines specifically for premium storage because workloads running on premium storage are highly performance sensitive we provide examples where appropriate you can also apply some of these guidelines to applications running on infrastructure as a service iaas vms with standard storage disks note sometimes what appears to be a disk performance issue is actually a network bottleneck in

accounts application performance indicators we assess whether an application is performing well or not by using performance indicators like how fast an application is processing a user request how much data an application is processing per request how many requests an application is processing in a specific period of time how long a user has to wait to get a response after submitting their request the technical terms for these performance indicators are iops throughput or bandwidth and latency in this section we discuss the common performance indicators in the context of premium storage in the section performance application checklist for disks you learn how to measure these performance indicators for your application later in optimize application performance you learn about the factors that affect these performance indicators and recommendations to optimize them iops iops is the number of requests that your application is sending to storage disks in one second an input output operation could be read or write sequential or random online transaction processing oltp applications like an online retail website need to process many concurrent user requests immediately the user requests are insert and update intensive database transactions which the application must process quickly for this reason oltp applications require very high iops oltp applications handle millions of small and random i o requests if you have such an application you must design the application infrastructure to optimize for iops for more information on all the factors to consider to get high iops see optimize application performance when you attach a premium storage disk to your high scale vm azure provisions for you a guaranteed number of iops according to the disk specification for example a p50 disk provisions 7 500 iops each high scale vm size also has a specific iops limit that</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"
